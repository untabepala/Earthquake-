<h1 style="color:white">HOW DO EARTHQUAKES CAUSE DAMAGE</h1>
<p style="color:navy"><b><span style="color:salmon">Earthquake destruction</span></b> begins with the earth’s violent shaking that can rupture the earth, trigger landslides and turn the surface of the earth to liquid. The damaging shaking of major earthquakes can be felt hundreds of miles away.</p>

<h3>Ground Shaking & Structural Failure</h3>
<p style="color:navy">Ground shaking is the vibration of the ground during an earthquake. The shaking triggers other hazards such as liquefaction and landslides. Most earthquake damage results from the seismic waves passing beneath buildings, roads, and other structures.</p>

<h3>Surface Rupture & Ground Displacement</h3>
<p style="color:navy">The primary earthquake hazard is surface rupture. It can be caused by vertical or horizontal movement on either side of a ruptured fault. Ground displacement, which can affect large land areas, can produce severe damage to structures, roads, railways and pipelines.</p>

<article>
<h3>Landslides</h3>
<p style="color:navy">Earthquakes can trigger landslides and mudslides, especially in areas with water-soaked soils. Landslides may result in falling rocks and debris that collide with people, trees, animals, buildings and vehicles. They also can block roads and disrupt utility lines.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>Liquefaction</h3>
<p style="color:navy">The shaking from an earthquake can turn loose soil into a liquid during an earthquake.
Liquefaction can undermine the foundations and supports of buildings, bridges, pipelines, and roads, causing them to sink into the ground, collapse or dissolve.

<h3>Tsunamis</h3>
<p style="color:navy"><a href= "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/tsunamis">Tusunami Facts</a>An earthquake generated within the Pacific Ocean floor will generate a tsunami, which is actually a series of very long waves. Large tsunamis which travel to the ocean floor to the surface are dangerous to human health, property, and infrastructure. Long lasting effects of tsunami destruction can be felt beyond the coastline. </p>

<h3>Fires</h3>
<p style="color:navy"><img src="fire.png" width="25"height="40"/>Earthquake damage facts show fires caused by earthquakes are the second most common hazard. Earthquake fires start when electrical and gas lines are dislodged due to the earth’s shaking. Gas is set free as gas lines are broken and a spark will start a firestorm.</p>
